# Discussion-App

This repository contains a discussion app that was a project for my Mobile Computing class using Android Studio
The front end was designed mainly using xml, java and Material design.
The initial backend stack was php and mysql and I used retrofit to make Internet Requests
The current one for display purposes has been migrated to Firebase in order to display the app and for
less backend maintainence and cost.
